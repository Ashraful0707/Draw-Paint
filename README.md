# Draw-Paint
I completed this project in My Internet Programming class. This Draw &amp; Paint Application let users to draw lines, ellipses, brush strokes and also allow to type at the center panel. The user can control the size, and color of all the shapes, lines, and letters through the use of various JComponents. I used Java Gui for this application.
